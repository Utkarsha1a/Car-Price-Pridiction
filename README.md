# Introduction

Second hand's car have a huge market base. Many consider to buy a Used Car intsead of buying of new one, as it's is feasible and a better investment.

The data used to build the model is taken from the car website CarDekho.com, filled with information on a wide variety of cars, including their selling price and present price. 

The objective of this project to make a end to end machine learning project and help others in figuring out their old car's selling price. By using this model we can ensure that how much one should pay for a specific type of car.

# About the Data

This dataset consists information about used car listed on cardekho.com. 

It has 9 columns each columns consists information about specific features like :   
Car_Name gives information about car company .which Year the brand new car has been purchased.selling_price the price at which car is being sold this will be target label for further prediction of price.km_driven number of kilometre car has been driven.fuel this feature the fuel type of car (CNG , petrol,diesel etc).seller_type tells whether the seller is individual or a dealer. transmission gives information about the whether the car is automatic and manual.owner number of previous owner of the car. Present_price what is the current showroom price of the car.

# Deployment Architecture:
The backend part of the application was made using Flask and for the frotend part HTML and CSS was used.The file "app.py" contains the entire flask code and inside the templates folder, "new.html" contains the homepage and "result.html" contains the result page.
